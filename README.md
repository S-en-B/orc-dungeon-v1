# Orc Dungeon Version 1
Orc Dungeon is a simple dungeon crawler created by myself. The final goal
includes but is not limited to multiple types of enemies, NPCs, and boss battles.
The only escape from these endless chambers is a magical coin. When I have time 
I'll make a version 2 in C++ with hopefully more enemies and procedurally generationed
rooms/levels.

## Feedback
Comments or suggestions are more than welcome as I still have a lot to learn
